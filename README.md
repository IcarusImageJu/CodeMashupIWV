# CodeMashupIWV

Welcome to the wildest web workshop west of the World Wide Web! Here at `CodeMashupIWV`, we mix code like cocktails, blend bugs like smoothies, and sometimes we even write stuff that works!

## Who Are We?
- **aVandalInShorts**: I wear shorts, I code, I conquer.
- **witheroux**: Brewing code and coffee, often confusing the two.
- **IcarusImageJu**: Flying close to the sun with only a laptop for wings.

## What's This All About?
Imagine a place where creativity meets chaos, and you've got a good idea of what we're doing here. We haven't decided what this website will be yet, but we promise it won't be boring. Expect flying divs, CSS that defies physics, and JavaScript that... well, does what JavaScript does.

## Collaboration
- **Rules**: There are no rules. Except for the rules we haven't made up yet.
- **Pull Requests**: Welcome! Especially if you bring pizza.
- **Code Reviews**: Will mostly involve laughing at our own jokes written in comments.

## Get Involved!
Want to jump in? Fork it, clone it, break it, fix it. We're here to have fun and maybe, just maybe, make something cool. Or at least something that compiles.

Remember, in the realm of `CodeMashupIWV`, every bug is a feature waiting to be promoted!
